# Dungeon Game
Dungeon crawler text adventure game for my Computer Science project
- Python text-based adventure game
- Move around many rooms of the dungeon
- Fight enemies in turn-based combat
- Pick up items and keys to help you explore
- Solve puzzles and learn about the story
- Final Boss...?

## Major bugs
- (FIXED) Glaring at an enemy while it is at 2 ATK will bring it to 0 - it will deal no damage
- On the Boss Puzzle 1, making an input before the reaction prompt will count that input anyway.

## Future improvements
- finish boss puzzle 3
- add enemy magic
- add torch dropping thing
- add ability to cancel after choosing magic or items in battle but not waste a turn
- add function to shop
- add rooms available to move to after choosing to move
- add points system

## Cheat codes (only use if you're stuck! (or if you want to be a menace))
- "jjwisacoolteacher" on Skip Cutscene prompt - removes all non-boss enemy encounters (DEBUG MODE)
- "justplaythegamenormally" on Skip Cutscene prompt - skips to the boss fight and skips long dialogue (LAZY MODE)
- "comeonthisoneiseasy" to skip West Dungeon mirror puzzle - on its rotate prompt
- "idonthavetime" to skip Boss Puzzle 1 - on its reaction prompt
- "dontgoogletheanswer" to skip Boss Puzzle 2 - on its flip bits prompt
