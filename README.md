# Dungeon Game
Dungeon crawler text adventure game for my Computer Science project
- Python text-based adventure game
- Move around many rooms of the dungeon
- Fight enemies in turn-based combat
- Pick up items and keys to help you explore
- Solve puzzles and learn about the story
- Final Boss...?

## How to Play
- If you're on GitHub, hop over to the latest release, download and extract the .zip file.
- You can also download the source code from the "Code" menu.
- Once you've extracted everything into a folder, double click game.py and play!

## Major bugs
- (FIXED) ~~Glaring at an enemy while it is at 2 ATK will bring it to 0 - it will deal no damage~~
- On the Boss Puzzle 1, making an input before the reaction prompt will count that input anyway
- On lazy mode, you go to the start of the game after finishing the boss. Maybe stop being lazy
- GOBLIN'S GREED simply doesn't work

## Future improvements
- (done) add tutorial
- (shhh) finish boss puzzle 3
- (done) add enemy magic
- (done) if an item is a consumable, show the hp it can heal
- (done) add function to shop
- (done) rework damage system


## Cheat codes (only use if you're stuck! (or if you're bad))
- "jjwisacoolteacher" on Skip Cutscene prompt - removes all non-boss enemy encounters (DEBUG MODE)
- "justplaythegamenormally" on Skip Cutscene prompt - skips to the boss fight and skips long dialogue (LAZY MODE)
- "comeonthisoneiseasy" to skip West Dungeon mirror puzzle - on its rotate prompt
- "idonthavetime" to skip Boss Puzzle 1 - on its reaction prompt
- "dontgoogletheanswer" to skip Boss Puzzle 2 - on its flip bits prompt

## Progression guide
1. Tutorial
2. Get Torch from the Shop (3)
3. Explore the West Dungeon (4) by completing the puzzle and getting a North key
4. Go through the East Entrance to the East Dungeon (5-6) and get the Vault key
5. Open the North Entrance (7) and take the Throne key from the Vault (8)
6. Go back through the East Dungeon (faster through the library) to the Throne Room (10)
7. Complete the Boss Fight (with two puzzles) and watch the cutscene
8. Choose to Save or Kill the boss
9. Go back through the dungeons towards the Entrance (0) to exit the dungeon and win the game

## Tips
- Make sure to pick up everything you come across, it could be useful!
- You don't have to go all the way to the bossfight - you can leave the dungeon with enough coins but I recommend the bossfight - it's quite easy and has a great storyline
- If your HP is low in a battle, you can either use an item to heal or use the healing spell
- Try and explore as many rooms as you can for a more fun experience
- Try and complete the puzzles without the cheat codes, but if you really need them you can use them
