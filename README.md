# Dungeon Game
Dungeon crawler text adventure game for my Computer Science project
- Python text-based adventure game
- Move around many rooms of the dungeon
- Fight enemies in turn-based combat
- Pick up items and keys to help you explore
- Solve puzzles and learn about the story
- Final Boss...?

## How to Play
- If you're on GitHub, hop over to the latest release, download and extract the .zip file.
- You can also download the source code from the "Code" menu.
- Once you've extracted everything into a folder, double click game.py and play!

## Major bugs
- (FIXED) ~~Glaring at an enemy while it is at 2 ATK will bring it to 0 - it will deal no damage~~
- On the Boss Puzzle 1, making an input before the reaction prompt will count that input anyway
- On lazy mode, you go to the start of the game after finishing the boss. Maybe stop being lazy
- GOBLIN'S GREED simply doesn't work

## Future improvements
- (done) add tutorial
- (shhh) finish boss puzzle 3
- (done) add enemy magic
- (done) if an item is a consumable, show the hp it can heal
- (done) add function to shop
- (done) rework damage system


## Cheat codes (only use if you're stuck! (or if you want to be a menace))
- "jjwisacoolteacher" on Skip Cutscene prompt - removes all non-boss enemy encounters (DEBUG MODE)
- "justplaythegamenormally" on Skip Cutscene prompt - skips to the boss fight and skips long dialogue (LAZY MODE)
- "comeonthisoneiseasy" to skip West Dungeon mirror puzzle - on its rotate prompt
- "idonthavetime" to skip Boss Puzzle 1 - on its reaction prompt
- "dontgoogletheanswer" to skip Boss Puzzle 2 - on its flip bits prompt
